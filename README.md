Utopia framework orchestration library is simple and lite library for abstarcting deb interaction with multiple container orchestrators. This library is aiming to be as simple and easy to learn and use. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

Although this library is part of the [Utopia Framework](https://github.com/utopia-php/framework) project it is dependency free and can be used as standalone with any other PHP project or framework.

## Getting Started

Install using composer:
```bash
composer require utopia-php/orchestration
```

Init in your application:
```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/../../vendor/autoload.php';

use Utopia\Orchestration\Orchestration;

// Init

```

## Usage
### Initialisation

There are currently two orchestrator adapters available and each of them have slightly different parameters:

- ### DockerAPI
    Directly communicates to the Docker Daemon using the Docker UNIX socket.

    ```php
    use Utopia\Orchestration\Orchestration;
    use Utopia\Orchestration\Adapter\DockerAPI;

    $orchestration = new Orchestration(new DockerAPI($username, $password, $email));
    ```
    $username, $password and $email are optional and are only used to pull private images from Docker Hub.

- ### DockerCLI
    Uses the Docker CLI to communicate to the Docker Daemon.
    ```php
    use Utopia\Orchestration\Orchestration;
    use Utopia\Orchestration\Adapter\DockerCLI;

    $orchestration = new Orchestration(new DockerCLI($username, $password));
    ```
    $username and $password are optional and are only used to pull private images from Docker Hub.

Once you have initialised your Orchestration object the following methods can be used:

- ### Pulling an image
    This method pulls the image requested from the orchestrators registry. It will return a boolean value indicating if the image was pulled successfully.

    ```php
    $orchestration->pull('image:tag');
    ```

- ### Running a container
    This method creates and runs a new container, On success it will return a string containing the container ID. On failure it will throw an exception.

        'name',
        ['echo', 'hello world!'],
